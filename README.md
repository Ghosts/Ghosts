### Hi there 👋
![Ghosts's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=ghosts&count_private=true)

- 👷‍♂️ Currently picking up any `help-wanted` & `good first issue` tags to get more active in the open source community, so if you're here because you're wondering who the heck I am, hello!
- 🧠 I'm usually working with React, .NET/.NET Core, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Redux, Svelte, and Angular.
- 🌱 Right now I'm excited to dive deeper into React, Redux, Angular, and TypeScript with open source contributions and side-projects.
- 👀 Looking to collaborate on web-based projects - either libraries, frameworks, or small apps.
- 📫 How to reach me: Best place would be email (on my GH) or via Twitter (also linked).
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
