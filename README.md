- 🏢 Current Front-End Engineer at Dashlane, former Fullstack Engineer at Visa. Most of my daily work is done in a private GitLab repo, so my GitHub is mostly reflective of side-projects and open source contributions.
- 👷‍♂️ Currently picking up any `help-wanted` & `good first issue` tags to get more active in the open source community, so if you're here because you're wondering who the heck I am, hello!
- 🧠 I'm usually working with React, JavaScript/TypeScript, Redux, and Svelte.
- 👀 Looking to collaborate on web-based projects - either libraries, frameworks, or small apps.
- 📫 How to reach me: Best place would be email (on my GH) or via Twitter (also linked).
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
